To make a library:
1) Run the command :
  ar rcs libNAME.a FILE.o

This will create the static library code.

2) Store this file (libNAME.a) in /usr/lib/.
     Should end up as /usr/lib/libNAME.a

3) Save the header file in /usr/include
     Should end up as /usr/include/header.h

4) To use:
     - Update the code to include <header.h>
     - Link in the library with -lNAME in the gcc -o command
     - Run 'sudo make' when building (to access the files)
